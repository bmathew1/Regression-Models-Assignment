###Executive Summary    
This report is a R markdown of the peer-graded assignment for Regression Models Coursera course.

The analysis in this assignment attempts to answer the following questions based on the `mtcars` dataset:    
- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?    
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions    

Based on the analysis MPG changes by 14.0794278 + -4.1413764 * weight (in 1000 lbs) for manual transmission in comparison with automatic transmission, when 1/4 mile time and weight are held constant. Below a weight of 3399.698 lbs manual transmission is better for MPG, but for weight above this value, automatic transmission is better.

###The analysis   
The `mtcars` dataset include data that was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, comprising of fuel consumption and 10 other aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). The features in the dataset are - `mpg`	- Miles/(US) gallon, `cyl` - Number of cylinders, `disp` - Displacement (cu.in.), `hp` - Gross horsepower, `drat` - Rear axle ratio, `wt` - Weight (1000 lbs), `qsec` - 1/4 mile time, `vs` - V/S, `am` - Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual), `gear` - Number of forward gears, `carb` - Number of carburetors   

####Loading the data    
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
```

Convert features to factors
```{r}
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl); mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs); 
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am); mtcars$gear <- as.factor(mtcars$gear); 
mtcars$carb <- as.factor(mtcars$carb)
```

**Following are the steps followed in identifying the best possible model to identify how `am` affects `mpg`**   
Plot a pairs plot of key variables that are expected affect `mpg`   
1. Determine parameters to include based on what was identified in the pairs plot   
2. Run model    
3. Assess the p-value for the coefficients, Adjusted R squared and Residual standard error for the degrees of freedom    
4. If untried alternate models exist, go to step 1    

Based on the assessment, the model chosen include `am`, `wt`, `qsec` and an interaction between `wt` and `am` - lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + wt*am, data = mtcars). Output of the key factors assessed are shown here:   

```{r echo=FALSE}
fit_wt_qsec_int3 <- lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + wt*am, data = mtcars)
summ <- summary(fit_wt_qsec_int3)
summ$coefficients
```

Low p-values for the coeficients (except the Intercept), showing a high level of signficance at 0.95 significance level.       
Based on the adjusted R squared the model explains ``r format((summ$adj.r.squared *100), digits=3)`%` of the variance    
Residual standard error with this model is ``r summ$sigma`` at ``r summ$df[2]`` degrees of freedom    

###Conslusion     
- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?  
        - This will depend on the `wt` of the car. Below `wt` of `r format(  abs( summ$coefficients[2] / summ$coefficients[5]))` manual transmission is better for MPG, but for `wt` above this value, automatic transmission is better.    
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions    
        - MPG changes by ``r summ$coefficients[2]` + `r summ$coefficients[5]` * wt` for manual transmission in comparison with automatic transmission, when `qsec` and `wt` are held constant.    

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
(testData <- mtcars[9,])
(autoMpg <- predict(fit_wt_qsec_int3, testData[,2:11]))
autoMpg + summ$coefficients[2] + summ$coefficients[5] * testData$wt
```

Various models that assessed in the process are shown below. Appendix shows some explorator analysis and assessment of final model.             
1. lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)   
2. lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)   
3. lm(mpg ~ am + wt, data = mtcars)    
4. lm(mpg ~ am + wt + disp, data = mtcars)   
5. lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec, data = mtcars)    
6. lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + wt*cyl, data = mtcars)   
7. lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + wt*disp, data = mtcars)   
8. lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + wt*am, data = mtcars)    
9. lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec + wt*am + qsec*cyl, data = mtcars)    
10. lm(mpg ~ am + disp, data = mtcars)    
11. lm(mpg ~ am + disp + qsec + wt*am, data = mtcars)    

###Appendix    

####Pair plot of key variables that are expected to impact mpg    
Plot of features that are expected to have an impact on mpg    

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
require(GGally)
ggpairs(mtcars, lower = list(continuous = "smooth"), columns  = 
            c("mpg", "wt", "disp","qsec", "cyl","am"), title="Factors affecting mpg")
```


**Some initial observations, from the plot, that may be relevant in decidnig inclusion or exclusion of features in the model:**   
* Both am and cyl seem to have an effect on mpg   
* mpg is negatively correlated with wt and disp, at -0.87 and -0.85 respectively. Inclusion of both in the model may impact the fit, but one of them        
* mpg is positively correlated with qsec, but is relatively weak at 0.42, a potential candidate for inclusion in the model   
* wt seems to be affected by am, hence may be a factor to be considered in the model      
* Highest correlation among continuous variables is between wt and displacement at 0.89. This may mean that inclusion of both variables in the model is not a good idea


**Based on analysing all the models, model 8 is chosen as the most appropriate. Plotting residuals to confirm that there are no other problems.**      

####Plot of the fit    
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit_wt_qsec_int3)
```

The plot shows:    
- no discernable patterns with residuals plotted against fitted values    
- points close to the line in QQ plot, hence close to normally distributed   
- no points exertng high leverage as outliers
